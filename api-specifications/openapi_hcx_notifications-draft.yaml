        The participant should send the below details in the request body while making a call for notification subscription.
          1. The protocol headers defined and used by all the other APIs to understand the sender, recipient, status etc,.
          2. The notification topic_code (as x-hcx-notification_subscription.topic_code) to understand the notification to which the participant want to subscribe.
        
        The response to this API could be one of the following:
          1. A successful accepted (202) response from the HCX gateway if the strucuture of the request is valid and the validation of open attributes (protocol headers) is successful. Upon successful validation, HCX gateway forwards the same request to the intended recipient asynchronously.
          2. A  successful OK (200) response from the HCX gateway if the strucuture of the request is valid and the validation of open attributes (protocol headers) is successful and the recipient is HCX gateway. There is no callback expected in this case.
          3. An error response if any of the validations fail.
        
        If the request is validated and accepted by HCX gateway, based on recipient it will be processed. If it recipient is not HCX gateway, the request will be forwarded to recipient and the participant should expect a response via callback API from recipient.

            1. Protected headers (**protected**) - A set of attributes that provide transport, security, message integrity and summary information about the message being exchanged.
        
            2. JWE element (**encrypted_key**) - Content Encryption Key.
        
            3. JWE element (**iv**) - Initialisation Vector for the algorithm.
        
            4. Encrypted Payload (**ciphertext**) - Payload containing the relevant domain entity (eObject) as prescribed for the use case by the domain specifications. This needs to be encrypted so that HCX cannot read this.
        
            5. Authentication tag (**authentication_tag**) - Digital signature on the protected header and the payload of the message to ensure its integrity.
            
            
            The final payload should be serialzed using JWE compact serialization as defined in the RFC-7516 -

Header values are posted in clear and must never contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about the patient or any person. HCX protocol uses JWE protected headers for such information to ensure these are not tampered with by the intermediate gateways. Protected Headers for HCX will be the union of the following three header categories.
          
                1. JOSE Headers - JSON Web encryption header as per [RFC7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-4). For HCX V1, this is proposed to be fixed to {"alg":"RSA-OAEP","enc":"A256GCM"}.
            
                2. HCX Protocol Headers - Private headers as per [RFC7516 section 4.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-4.3). List of header values that are allowed in HCX APIs and their details are defined in this [section](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-technical-specifications/open-protocol/key-components-building-blocks#hcx-protocol-headers) of HCX Specifications.
            
                3. HCX Domain Headers - JSON object containing a map of domain-specific header values as proposed in domain data specifications for each entity. E.g. For claims use cases, domain specs may decide to populate the total claimed amount, list of diagnostics/procedures. Please note that all such parameter names must follow the naming convention _x-hcx-<use_case_name>-<parameter_name>_.
                
                4. HCX Notification Headers - JSON object containing a map of notification and the subscription details.

            
                  Overall, the protected headers should be created as - 
                  
                  
                  JWE Protected Header = BASE64URL(UTF8( (JOSE headers) + (HCX Protocol Headers) + (HCX Domain Headers) + (HCX Notification Headers) ))

                2. Encrypt the CEK with the recipient's public key using the RSAES-OAEP algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key.
            
                3. Base64url-encode the JWE Encrypted Key.
          
            
                The encrypted & base64 encoded key should be set as the encrypted_key in the JWE token and also used for encrypting the domain payload (i.e. the FHIR resource) to be sent in the request. The recipient shall decrypt the content encryption key using their private key (corresponding to the public key used by the sender) and use the decrypted CEK for decrypting the domain payload.

              description: Initialization vector (_iv_) is needed in the encryption process of the payload and for the recipient (along with the encrypted_key and aad) to subsequently decrypt the payload. The "iv" should be created by generating a random JWE initialization vector and Base64url-encoding the JWE initialization vector.

            ciphertext:
              type: string
              description: _ciphertext_ contains the domain payload (that has to  be sent to the recipient) in encrypted form. Usecase specific   JSON payload defined in the [eObjects](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-specifications/domain-data-models/eobjects) section of the HCX specifications (i.e. the FHIR resource defined for the use case, e.g. CoverageEligibilityRequest document for coverage eligibility request API) should be encrypted as per JWE specification and sent as the _ciphertext_ in the request.
          
          
                Steps to create the ciphertext element - 
            
                1. Create the JSON payload for the API request as per the [eObjects specification](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-specifications/domain-data-models/eobjects).
            
                2. Perform authenticated encryption on the JSON payload with the AES GCM algorithm using the CEK as the encryption key (_encrypted_key_), the JWE Initialization Vector (_iv_)), and the Additional Authenticated Data value (_aad_), requesting a 128-bit Authentication Tag output. This step outputs a ciphertext and an authentication tag (_tag_).
            
                3. Base64url-encode the ciphertext output from the previous step and set it as the _ciphertext_ element in the request body.
              example: "KDlTtXchhZTGufMYmOYGS4HffxPSUrfmqCHXaI9wOGY"
              
            authentication_tag:
              type: string
              description: The authentication tag generated as an output of the payload encryption algorithm (used for creating the _ciphertext_) should be sent as the _tag_ element in the request body. This tag is required for decrypting the encrypted payload.
